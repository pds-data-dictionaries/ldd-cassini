   name                   geometry_reference_time_utc
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Date_Time_YMD_UTC
   description            For some observations, geometric parameters are given as instantaneous values at a specific time. Another set of instantaneous parameters are the parameters which give the minimum and maximum values in the product. In some cases, these range values are all calculated for the same time. If the label includes single valued geometric parameters or min/max range parameters determined for a specific time, geometry_reference_time_utc gives the time for which these values were calculated and must be given in the label. For some instruments, particularly those with relatively large exposure durations, (e.g., push broom cameras, many imaging spectrometers), many geometric quantities are given as ranges. If those range parameters are associated with the beginning and end of the observation (start_parameter/stop_parameter), geometry_start_time_utc/stop_time must be given. Comments within the label should be used to ensure the parameter vs. time association is unambiguous. 

   name                   geometry_reference_time_tdb
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The geometry reference time given in the 'Barycentric Dynamical Time' system, as a number of elapsed seconds since the J2000 epoch. This is consistent with the definition of 'ephemeris time' as used in the SPICE toolkit. The value must correspond to the time specified in the geometry_reference_time_utc attribute.

   name                   geometry_start_time_utc
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Date_Time_YMD_UTC
   description            The pair of geometry_start_time_utc/geometry_stop_time_utc may be given in the label for any observation. The pair is generally used for fairly long duration observations (a substantial portion of an hour to several hours). geometry_start_time_utc gives the time at the beginning of the observation. When either geometry_start_time_utc or geometry_stop_time_utc is given, both must be provided. Within the Geometry discipline, there are two options for providing geometric parameters as a range of values. A parameter may be given as a pair where the parameter values are those at the beginning and end of the observation (start_parameter, stop_parameter). If a (start_parameter, stop_parameter) pair is used for any geometric parameter, the pair (geometry_start_time_utc/geometry_stop_time_utc) must be given. Another option to provide geometric parameters as a pair is (minimum_parameter, maximum_parameter) defining a range of values where the values are the minimum and maximum values of that parameter for the entire observation. Comments within the label should be used to ensure the parameter vs. time association is unambiguous.

   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            Specifies the state or configuration of this instance of Geometry_Lander applies. Use of this attribute enables multiple instances of Geometry_Lander, describing the geometry under different conditions. Note that it is legal for more than one instance to have the same geometry_state, in which case the local_identifier should be used to differentiate the instances, along with description. If not present, the semantics of "Telemetry" should be assumed. It is not required that instances be retained; a derived product may have an Adjusted instance but remove the Telemetry one, for example.

   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The solution_id attribute specifies the unique identifier for the solution set to which the values in the group belong. For certain kinds of information, such as pointing correction (pointing models) and rover localization (coordinate system definitions), the "true" value is unknown and only estimates of the true value exist. Thus, more than one set of estimates may exist simultaneously, each valid for its intended purpose. Each of these sets is called a "solution" to the unknown true value. The solution_id attribute is used to identify which solution is being expressed by the containing group. No specific naming convention is defined here, however it is recommended that projects adopt one. The intent is to be able to identify who created the solution, and why. Possible components of the naming convention include user, institution, purpose, request ID, version, program, date/time.

   description            The instrument_azimuth attribute specifies the value for an instrument's rotation in the horizontal direction. It may be measured from a low hard stop, or relative to a coordinate frame. Although it may be used for any instrument where it makes sense, it is primarily intended for use in surface-based instruments that measure pointing in terms of azimuth and elevation. If this value is expressed using a coordinate system, the coordinate system is specified by the Coordinate_Space_Reference class. The interpretation of exactly what part of the instrument is being pointed is mission-specific. It could be the boresight, the camera head direction, the CAHV camera model A vector direction, or any of a number of other things. As such, for multimission use this value should be used mostly as an approximation, e.g. identifying scenes which might contain a given object.

   description            The longitude_direction attribute identifies the direction of longitude (e.g. Positive East or Positive West) for a planet. The IAU definition for direction of positive longitude should be adopted: http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/groups/IAU-WGCCRE. Typically, for planets with prograde (direct) rotations, positive longitude direction is to the west. For planets with retrograde rotations, positive longitude direction is to the east. Generally the Positive West longitude_direction is used for planetographic systems and Positive East is used for planetocentric systems. If the data is defined with Spatial_Domain in a manner not recommended by the IAU, there is a optional Secondary_Spatial_Domain section to define a second set of bounding coordinates such that both Positive East and Positive West bounding coordinates can be provided.

   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            There are three basic types of coordinate systems: body-fixed rotating, body-fixed non-rotating, and inertial. A body-fixed coordinate system is one associated with the body (e.g., a planet or satellite). The body-fixed system is centered on the body and rotates with the body (unless it is a non-rotating type), whereas an inertial coordinate system is fixed at some point in space. Currently, the PDS has specifically defined two types of body-fixed rotating coordinate systems: planetocentric and planetographic. However, the set of related data elements are modeled such that definitions for other body-fixed rotating coordinate systems, body-fixed non-rotating and inertial coordinate systems can be added as the need arises. Contact a PDS data engineer for assistance in defining a specific coordinate system.

   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The latitude_type attribute defines the type of latitude (planetographic, planetocentric) used within a cartographic product and as reflected in attribute values within associated PDS labels. For planets and satellites, latitude is measured north and south of the equator; north latitudes are designated as positive. The planetocentric latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line from the center of the body. The planetographic latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line that is normal to the body. In summary, both latitudes are equivalent on a sphere (i.e., equatorial radius equal to polar radius); however, they differ on an ellipsoid (e.g., Mars, Earth).

For raster data, the value is normally the pixel size in angular units (currently degrees). For vector data (points, lines, polygons), it is a little less concrete and usually indicates the fuzzy tolerance or clustering/streaming setting that establishes the minimum distance at which two points will NOT be automatically merged during data collection. This should also be reported in angular units (currently degrees).

   description             The pixel_resolution_x and pixel_resolution_y attributes indicate the image array pixel resolution (distance/pixel or degree/pixel) relative to the Cartesian (x,y) coordinate system as defined by the map projection. Due to varying properties across different map projections, actual surface distances for an individual pixel may be accurate only at specific location(s) within the image array (e.g. reference latitude or longitude, standard parallels, etc). For most PDS products, x and y resolution values are equal ('square' pixels). The inclusion of both x and y attributes allows for anticipated products where resolution may differ for each axis ('rectangular' pixels). NOTE: Definition of this PDS4 attribute differs from how 'resolution' was defined within PDS3.

Due to varying properties across different map projections, actual surface distances for an individual pixel may be accurate only at specific location(s) within the image array (e.g. reference latitude or longitude, standard parallels, etc). For most PDS products, x and y scale values are equal ('square' pixels). The inclusion of both x and y attributes allows for anticipated products where scale may differ for each axis ('rectangular' pixels). NOTE 1: For presentation of hard-copy maps, a map scale is traditionally expressed as a 'representative fraction' (the ratio of a hard-copy map to the actual subject surface (e.g. 1:250,000, where one unit of measure on the map equals 250,000 of the same unit on the body surface)). This usage is relevant when map/data are presented on hard-copy media (paper, computer screen,etc). When defining pixel scale within a stored image/array context here, we are expressing a ratio between the image array and the actual surface (thus, pixel/degree or pixel/distance units).

   description            Provides the ordinary latitude coordinate of the origin (oblique latitude = oblique longitude = 0) for the oblique coordinate system used to specify the Oblique Cylindrical projection, for example, as used in Cassini BIDR (basic image data record). Note that whereas some past PDS products may utilize oblique projections defined solely in terms of the reference_latitude and reference_longitude (i.e., with a third defining angle always set to zero), the Cassini BIDRs require the full generality of three nonzero rotation angles. These angles are represented by the keywords oblique_proj_pole_latitude, oblique_proj_pole_longitude, and oblique_proj_pole_rotation. The values of reference_latitude and reference_longitude are consistent with the latter three angles but do not uniquely define the oblique coordinate system on their own.

   description            Provides the clockwise rotation of the line and sample coordinate system with respect to the map projection origin. Note that a value of 90.0 is used for all Cassini BIDRs (basic image data record) indicating that lines of the projected image have constant oblique-system longitude and columns have constant oblique-system latitude. As stated in the Cassini BIDR SIS (software interface specification), for these images, it was convenient to represent longitude in the line direction so that the images, which are elongated along the equator of the oblique system, are larger in the line direction than in the sample direction.

Unit vector in the direction of the X axis of the oblique coordinate system used in the Oblique Cylindrical projection, in terms of the X, Y, and Z axes of the standard body-fixed coordinate system. In each system, the X axis points from the body center toward longitude and latitude (0,0) in that system, the Z axis to (0,90), and the Y-axis completes a right-handed set. The oblique_proj_x/y/z_axis_vector(s) make up the rows of a rotation matrix that when multiplied on the left of a vector referenced to the standard coordinate system converts it into its equivalent in the oblique coordinate system. This rotation matrix is the product of successively applied rotations by oblique_proj_pole_longitude around the Z axis, 90 oblique_proj_pole_latitude around the once-rotated Y axis, and oblique_proj_pole_rotation around the twice-rotated Z axis.

   description            The value (Right, Left or Both) indicates the side of the spacecraft ground-track to which the antenna is pointed for data acquired within this file. The SAR (synthetic aperture radar) images stored in the BIDR (basic image data record) files are always acquired on only one side of the ground-track for each Titan pass. This value also indicates from which side the SAR image is illuminated. If the spacecraft images to the left of its ground-track (look_direction=Left), the image will be illuminated from the (viewer's) left side, and, conversely, if the spacecraft looks to the right, the illumination will come from the right in the image file. The direction of illumination is critical to interpretation of features in the image.

The equirectangular projection is used for observations of Saturn and its satellites, but not for the rings. The sample coordinate is West longitude (in units of degrees), which decreases with increasing sample index, so that surface features appear correctly when the cube line/sample planes are displayed with sample index increasing from left to right. CAVEAT USOR: Several examples of CIRS cubes do not appear to correctly identify their min/max footprint width/heights. For example, some using equirectangular projection list their max footprint width as 360 deg, even when there is no wrapping.

   description             The PDS3 name for this attribute was CSS:MIN_FOOTPRINT_SAMPLE (with MAP_PROJECTION_TYPE = POINT_PERSPECTIVE), and was defined as "Minimum size of footprints along the sample axis". The meaning of this is unclear, but we believe it means the (angular) length along the horizontal direction of the smallest footprint (a CIRS detector) on the pixel grid, and have renamed it in PDS4 accordingly as pointperspective_min_footprint_width. The equirectangular projection only includes fields of view which fall on the target body and thus does not preserve spectra taken off the limb of the target (which are important at Saturn or Titan, for example), and also does not preserve the original viewing geometry of the observation. We therefore also generate point perspective projection cubes, which approximate the appearance of the target body in the plane of the sky as seen from the spacecraft, and preserve spectra of the limb regions and the surrounding regions of deep space. The sample coordinate is the scaled offset from the body center, in the direction of decreasing J2000 Right Ascension, in milliradians. To generate these cubes, the field of view of each spectrum is first expressed as an offset, in milliradians, from the instantaneous direction of the target body center. The sample coordinate is the offset in the direction of decreasing J2000 Right Ascension, and the line coordinate is the offset in the direction of increasing J2000 Declination. To correct for the changing distance to the target during the activity, these offsets are then multiplied by the ratio of the distance to the target body center at the time of the observation to the distance to the target body center at the start of the observation, so that the apparent size of the body is constant with time. The resulting scaled offsets for each field of view are then projected onto the cube grid and averaged as described in Table 4.1 of the CIRS Cube SIS. Fields of view further than 3 times the angular size of the target are not included in the cube, in order to limit the cube size. We have not generated point perspective projections for the ring observations because few ring observations were taken in a way that would make point perspective images useful.

The resulting scaled offsets for each field of view are then projected onto the cube grid and averaged as described in Table 4.1 of the CIRS Cube SIS. Fields of view further than 3 times the angular size of the target are not included in the cube, in order to limit the cube size. We have not generated point perspective projections for the ring observations because few ring observations were taken in a way that would make point perspective images useful. CAVEAT USOR: Several examples of CIRS cubes do not appear to correctly identify their min/max footprint width/heights. For example, some using equirectangular projection list their max footprint width as 360 deg, even when there is no wrapping.

   description             The PDS3 name for this attribute was CSS:MAX_FOOTPRINT_LINE (with MAP_PROJECTION_TYPE = POINT_PERSPECTIVE), and was defined as "Maximum size of footprints along the line axis". The meaning of this is unclear, but we believe it means the (angular) length along the vertical direction of the largest footprint (a CIRS detector) on the pixel grid, and have renamed it in PDS4 accordingly as pointperspective_max_footprint_height. The equirectangular projection only includes fields of view which fall on the target body and thus does not preserve spectra taken off the limb of the target (which are important at Saturn or Titan, for example), and also does not preserve the original viewing geometry of the observation. We therefore also generate point perspective projection cubes, which approximate the appearance of the target body in the plane of the sky as seen from the spacecraft, and preserve spectra of the limb regions and the surrounding regions of deep space. The line coordinate is the scaled offset from the body center, in the direction of increasing J2000 Declination, in milliradians. To generate these cubes, the field of view of each spectrum is first expressed as an offset, in milliradians, from the instantaneous direction of the target body center. The sample coordinate is the offset in the direction of decreasing J2000 Right Ascension, and the line coordinate is the offset in the direction of increasing J2000 Declination.

   description             The PDS3 name for this attribute was CSS:MIN_FOOTPRINT_SAMPLE (with MAP_PROJECTION_TYPE = RING_POLAR), and was defined as "Minimum size of footprints along the sample axis". The meaning of this is unclear, but we believe it means the length along the horizontal direction of the smallest footprint (a CIRS detector) on the pixel grid, and have renamed it in PDS4 accordingly as ringpolar_min_footprint_width. TThe ring polar, also known as ring radius/local time, projection is used for observations of Saturn's rings. The representation of ring data requires a unique projection. The rings are modeled by a thin disk centered on Saturn and in its equatorial plane, with an outer radius of 500,000km. If the field of view falls partially or completely beyond this limit or if it intersects the primary body before intersecting the rings, the data will not be included. If A is the location of the intersection of the CIRS field of view with Saturn’s equatorial plane, the sample coordinate is the distance of A from the center of Saturn (in units of km), and the line coordinate is the local time on Saturn at the intersection with Saturn’s surface of the line between A and Saturn’s center. Local time is expressed in fractional hours, from 0.0 (at midnight) to 12.0 (at noon), to 24.0 (at midnight).

   name                   Quaternion_Base
   description            The Quaternion_Base class defines a quaternion that represents rotation between two right-handed reference frames. In this dictionary, quaternions are always constructed so that the application of the quaternion describes the rotation of one frame to a second frame. The two frames and the direction of rotation must be identified unambiguously in the enclosing classes. Quaternions are expressed as a set of four numbers in the order (qcos, qsin1, qsin2, qsin3), where qcos = cos(theta/2) and qsin(n) = sin(theta/2)*a(n). Theta is the angle of rotation and a is the unit vector (x,y,z) around which the rotation occurs. A document providing the full mathematical basis for this construction, along with examples, and a summary of common pitfalls, is in preparation. The current version can be obtained by contacting the PDS Engineering Node. In application you need to know the four elements of the quaternion, the two end point frames, and the direction of the rotation. This dictionary provides two extensions to this Base class. In the Quaternion_Plus_Direction class we require the direction of rotation. This class can only be used if the two end point frames are identified in the enclosing class. This is generally the case in the Lander section. The Quaternion_Plus_To_From class requires the two frames be identified explicitly with one designated as the "from frame" and the other as the "to frame".

   name                   Quaternion_Model_Transform
   description            The Quaternion_Model_Transform class specifies, along with Vector_Model_Transform class, the transform used for the camera model in an image. Camera models created by the calibration process have associated with them a pose, comprised of the position (offset) and orientation (quaternion) of the camera at the time it was calibrated. The model is transformed ("pointed") for a specific image by computing, generally using articulation device kinematics, a final pose for the image. The camera model is then translated and rotated from the calibration to final pose. This class specifies the quaternion portion of the final pose.

This class is essentially the same as the class of the same name in the Display Dictionary, and is redefined here for convenience.

   name                   Image_Display_Geometry
   description            Image_Display_Geometry class provides an unambiguous description of the orientation of the image contents. This class assumes an image is displayed as described by a disp:Display_Direction class elsewhere in the label. In the unusual case where an image object does not have an associated disp:Display_Direction class, then, and only then, the optionalgeom:Display_Direction class in this class should be present. Coupled with the information in the associated Display_Direction class, any one of the Object_Orientation_* classes should allow unambiguous orientation of the contents of the image. The Local_Internal_Reference class is used to identify the object to which this instance of the Image_Display_Geometry class applies, and must be used if there is more than one instance of Image_Display_Geometry in the label. The appropriate value for local_reference_type is image_display_to_object. The Object_Orientation_North_East class is typically used for instruments for which the entire field of view is a portion of the target surface (e.g., instruments on Mars orbital spacecraft); otherwise use Object_Orientation_RA_Dec (e.g., flyby missions, missions with orbit radii much larger than the target radius such as Voyager or Cassini). At least one of these must be used. The two *_Identification classes used here are Central_Body (e.g., Saturn if you are using Planetocentric or planetographic coordinates in the Saturn system) and Target when the described object in the FoV is not the Central_Body. For example giving the orientation of the pole of Enceladus in Saturn Planetocentric coordinates, Central_Body = Saturn, Target = Enceladus. Bottom line: put in enough information so someone else can figure out the orientation of the field of view. We also offer an option to provide the pointing information as a quaternion.

   name                   Vector_Model_Transform
   description            The Vector_Model_Transform class specifies, along with the Quaternion_Model_Transform class, the transform used for the camera model in this image. Camera models created by the calibration process have associated with them a pose, comprised of the position (offset) and orientation (quaternion) of the camera at the time it was calibrated. The model is transformed ("pointed") for a specific image by computing, generally using articulation device kinematics, a final pose for the image. The camera model is then translated and rotated from the calibration to final pose. This class specifies the offset portion of the final pose.

   name                   Geometry_Orbiter
   description            The Geometry_Orbiter class is a container for geometric information (positions, velocities, orientations, etc.) relevant to orbiter or flyby spacecraft observations. If any of the contained classes or attributes have central body, and or target in the class or attribute name (e.g., spacecraft_to_central_body_distance, Vector_Planetocentric_Position_Spacecraft_To_Target), then the central body and or target must be identified in this class. If more than one geometry_reference_time_utc, target or central body need to be identified to fully describe the data, use multiple instances of the Geometry_Orbiter class. Do not use Coordinate_System at this level if more than one coordinate system is used in the contained classes. If more than one coordinate system is used, specify Coordinate_System in each of the subordinate classes where it is appropriate.

   name                   Device_Pose
   description            Defines the pose of this articulation device. The name indicates what exactly is being measured and how, and disambiguates if there is more than one Device_Pose. For example, Mars 2020 has "arm_attitude_reference", which indicates the pose of the rover that was used to calculate gravity droop of the arm. The interpretation of the pose is mission-specific; see the mission documentation.

   description            The CAHV model is a linear, perspective-projection camera model (equivalent to a pinhole camera). It consists of four 3-vectors (C,A,H,V) that describe the internal and external camera model parameters needed to translate between 2D image coordinates and 3D world coordinates. C (Vector_Center) is the 3D position of the pinhole (center of the entrance pupil). A (Vector_Axis) is a unit vector normal to the image plane pointing outward. H (Vector_Horizontal) is a composite vector encoding three quantities: H' (a vector in the image plane perpendicular to the vertical columns), Hs (the distance between the lens center and image plane, measured in horizontal pixels), and Hc (the horizontal image coordinate directly under C when moving parallel to A). V (Vector_Vertical) similarly composites the analogous V', Vs, and Vc in the vertical direction.

   name                   PSPH_Model
   description             A new camera model designed to perform better fisheye-image rectification prior to 1D stereo correlation. The primary innovation is the use of a unit projection sphere rather than an image plane. For epipolar alignment between stereo cameras the rows (for a left/right pair) or the columns (for an up/down pair) of both must lie along the same plane. Thus we use a pair of planes to define the rows and columns. Each plane will rotate around a static dedicated axis passing through the sphere center. Pixels will be located where the planes intersect with each other and the unit sphere.

   name                   Motion_Counter
   description            The Motion_Counter class provides a set of integers that describe a (potentially) unique location (position / orientation) for a rover or other movable object. Each time an event occurs that results in a movement, a new motion counter value is created. This includes intentional motion due to drive commands, as well as potential motion due to other articulating devices, such as arms or antennae. This motion counter (or part of it) is used as a reference to define instances of coordinate systems that can move such as SITE or ROVER frames. The motion counter is defined in a mission-specific manner. Although the original intent was to have incrementing indices (e.g., MER), the motion counter could also contain any integer values that conform to the above definition, such as time or spacecraft clock values.

Here we define latitude_of_projection_origin as mandatory and at CART LDD version 1934 have made scale_factor_at_projection_origin optional. For context, these two keywords have the same impact on the final product but are just different ways to define it. Thus, for example in the PROJ library, if both are made available, the latitude_of_projection_origin (+lat_ts) will be used instead of scale_factor_at_projection_origin (+k_0). Note, if you do supply the optional attribute scale_factor_at_projection_origin, the default scale (+k_0) for planetary polar data will mostly likely be set to 1.0.

   name                   Stereographic
   description            The Stereographic class contains parameters Stereographic projection. While this can be used for polar regions (generally where latitude_of_projection_origin = +-90), it is more appropriate to use the Polar_Stereographic class (should be identical in use). Synder 1987, DOI:10.3133/pp1395, page 154: https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1395/report.pdf#page=166 PROJ: https://proj.org/operations/projections/stere.html Note that most applications will either define latitude_of_projection_origin or scale_factor_at_projection_origin, but not both. Here we define latitude_of_projection_origin as mandatory and have made scale_factor_at_projection_origin optional. For context, these two keywords have the same impact on the final product but are just different ways to define it. Thus, for example in the PROJ library, if both are made available, the latitude_of_projection_origin (+lat_ts) will be used instead of scale_factor_at_projection_origin (+k_0). Note, if you do supply the optional attribute scale_factor_at_projection_origin, the default scale (+k_0) for planetary polar data will mostly likely be set to 1.0 in software.

   description            This is an in-situ projection that provides an overhead view. By projecting to a surface model, the need for range data is eliminated, but significant layover effects can happen when the actual geometry does not match the surface model. It has a constant scale in meters/pixel, subject to layover distortion.

   description            The Vector_Projection_Origin class specifies the location of the origin of the projection. For Polar and Cylindrical projections, this is the XYZ point from which all the azimuth/elevation rays emanate. For the Cylindrical-Perspective projection, this defines the center of the circle around which the synthetic camera orbits. For Orthographic, Orthorectified, and Vertical projections, this optional keyword specifies the point on the projection plane that serves as the origin of the projection (i.e. all points on a line through this point in the direction of PROJECTION_Z_AXIS_VECTOR will be located at X=Y=0 in the projection). If not present, (0,0,0) should be assumed. This translation is generally not necessary and not often used; the (X|Y)_AXIS_MINIMUM and (X|Y)_AXIS_MAXIMUM fields allow the mosaic to be located arbitrarily in the projection plane.

   name                   Ring_Polar
   description            The representation of ring data requires a unique projection. The rings are modeled by a thin disk centered on the body and in its equatorial plane. For Saturn, the thin disk is centered on Saturn and in its equatorial plane, with an outer radius of 500,000km. If the field of view falls partially or completely beyond this limit or if it intersects the primary body before intersecting the rings, the data will not be included. Plotted coordinates are derived as follows. If A is the location of the intersection of the CIRS field of view with the body's equatorial plane, the X coordinate is the distance of A from the center of the body (e.g. Saturn), and the Y coordinate is the local time on on the body at the intersection with the body's surface of the line between A and the body's center. Local time is expressed in fractional hours, from 0.0 (at midnight) to 12.0 (at noon), to 24.0 (at midnight).

   name                   Geo_Transformation
   description            The Geo_Transformation describes the relationship between raster positions (in pixel/line coordinates) and georeferenced coordinates. This is defined by an affine transform. The affine transform consists of six coefficients which map pixel/line coordinates into georeferenced space using the following relationship: Xgeo = GT(0) + Xpixel*GT(1) + Yline*GT(2) Ygeo = GT(3) + Xpixel*GT(4) + Yline*GT(5) or also defined as: GT[0] = Xmin; // upperleft_corner_y GT[1] = CellSize in X; // W-E pixel size, pixel_resolution_x GT[2] = 0; // rotation term, 0 if 'North Up' GT[3] = Ymax; // upperleft_corner_y GT[4] = 0; // shear term, 0 if 'North Up' GT[5] = CellSize in Y; // N-S pixel size, pixel_resolution_y In case of north up images, the GT(2) and GT(4) coefficients are zero, and the GT(1) is pixel width (pixel_resolution_x), and GT(5) is pixel height (pixel_resolution_y). The (GT(0),GT(3)) position is the top left corner of the top left pixel of the raster. Note that the pixel/line coordinates in the above are from (0.5,0.5) at the top left corner of the top left pixel to (width_in_pixels,height_in_pixels) at the bottom right corner of the bottom right pixel. The pixel/line location of the center of the top left pixel would therefore be (1.0,1.0).
