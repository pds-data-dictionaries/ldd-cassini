In the unusual case where an image object does not have an associated disp:Display_Direction class, then, and only then, the optionalgeom:Display_Direction class in this class should be present. Coupled with the information in the associated Display_Direction class, any one of the Object_Orientation_* classes should allow unambiguous orientation of the contents of the image. The Local_Internal_Reference class is used to identify the object to which this instance of the Image_Display_Geometry class applies, and must be used if there is more than one instance of Image_Display_Geometry in the label. The appropriate value for local_reference_type is image_display_to_object. The Object_Orientation_North_East class is typically used for instruments for which the entire field of view is a portion of the target surface (e.g., instruments on Mars orbital spacecraft); otherwise use Object_Orientation_RA_Dec (e.g., flyby missions, missions with orbit radii much larger than the target radius such as Voyager or Cassini). At least one of these must be used. The two *_Identification classes used here are Central_Body (e.g., Saturn if you are using Planetocentric or planetographic coordinates in the Saturn system) and Target when the described object in the FoV is not the Central_Body. For example giving the orientation of the pole of Enceladus in Saturn Planetocentric coordinates, Central_Body = Saturn, Target = Enceladus. Bottom line: put in enough information so someone else can figure out the orientation of the field of view. We also offer an option to provide the pointing information as a quaternion.

"geom:Quaternion_Base:1               ","Class","Quaternion_Base","1.0.0.0","geom","The Quaternion_Base class defines a quaternion that represents rotation between two right-handed reference frames. In this dictionary, quaternions are always constructed so that the application of the quaternion describes the rotation of one frame to a second frame. The two frames and the direction of rotation must be identified unambiguously in the enclosing classes. Quaternions are expressed as a set of four numbers in the order (qcos, qsin1, qsin2, qsin3), where qcos = cos(theta/2) and qsin(n) = sin(theta/2)*a(n). Theta is the angle of rotation and a is the unit vector (x,y,z) around which the rotation occurs. A document providing the full mathematical basis for this construction, along with examples, and a summary of common pitfalls, is in preparation. The current version can be obtained by contacting the PDS Engineering Node. In application you need to know the four elements of the quaternion, the two end point frames, and the direction of the rotation. This dictionary provides two extensions to this Base class. In the Quaternion_Plus_Direction class we require the direction of rotation. This class can only be used if the two end point frames are identified in the enclosing class. This is generally the case in the Lander section. The Quaternion_Plus_To_From class requires the two frames be identified explicitly with one designated as the "from frame" and the other as the "to frame". ","geo","","","","","","","","","","",""

"cassini:CIRS_Cubes_Specific_Attributes:2 cassini:ringpolar_max_footprint_height:1","Attribute","ringpolar_max_footprint_height","n/a","cassini"," The PDS3 name for this attribute was CSS:MAX_FOOTPRINT_LINE (with MAP_PROJECTION_TYPE = RING_POLAR), and was defined as ""Maximum size of footprints along the line axis"". The meaning of this is unclear, but we believe it means the (angular) length along the vertical direction of the largest footprint (a CIRS detector) on the pixel grid, in units of hrs, and have renamed it in PDS4 accordingly as ringpolar_max_footprint_height. TThe ring polar, also known as ring radius/local time, projection is used for observations of Saturn's rings. The representation of ring data requires a unique projection. The rings are modeled by a thin disk centered on Saturn and in its equatorial plane, with an outer radius of 500,000km. If the field of view falls partially or completely beyond this limit or if it intersects the primary body before intersecting the rings, the data will not be included. If A is the location of the intersection of the CIRS field of view with Saturn’s equatorial plane, the sample coordinate is the distance of A from the center of Saturn (in units of km), and the line coordinate is the local time on Saturn at the intersection with Saturn’s surface of the line between A and Saturn’s center. Local time is expressed in fractional hours, from 0.0 (at midnight) to 12.0 (at noon), to 24.0 (at midnight). We have not generated point perspective projections for the ring observations because few ring observations were taken in a way that would make point perspective images useful.

The appropriate file is selected automatically by CISSCAL based on two criteria: the filter combination used for the observation, and the temperature range of the optics (-5°C and below, -5°C to 25°C, or above 25°C). The selection is managed through a database file called slope_db.tab, which maps filter combinations and temperature ranges to specific slope filenames. The slope files themselves are in VICAR format and contain a 1024x1024 array (for full-frame images) of floating-point correction factors that are divided into the image during the flat field correction step.
