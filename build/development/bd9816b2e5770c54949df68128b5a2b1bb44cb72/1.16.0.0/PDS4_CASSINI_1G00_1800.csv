The equirectangular projection only includes fields of view which fall on the target body and thus does not preserve spectra taken off the limb of the target (which are important at Saturn or Titan, for example), and also does not preserve the original viewing geometry of the observation.

"cassini:CIRS_Cubes_Specific_Attributes:2 cassini:ringpolar_max_footprint_height:1","Attribute","ringpolar_max_footprint_height","n/a","cassini"," The PDS3 name for this attribute was CSS:MAX_FOOTPRINT_LINE (with MAP_PROJECTION_TYPE = RING_POLAR), and was defined as ""Maximum size of footprints along the line axis"". The meaning of this is unclear, but we believe it means the (angular) length along the vertical direction of the largest footprint (a CIRS detector) on the pixel grid, in units of hrs, and have renamed it in PDS4 accordingly as ringpolar_max_footprint_height. TThe ring polar, also known as ring radius/local time, projection is used for observations of Saturn's rings. The representation of ring data requires a unique projection. The rings are modeled by a thin disk centered on Saturn and in its equatorial plane, with an outer radius of 500,000km. If the field of view falls partially or completely beyond this limit or if it intersects the primary body before intersecting the rings, the data will not be included. If A is the location of the intersection of the CIRS field of view with Saturn’s equatorial plane, the sample coordinate is the distance of A from the center of Saturn (in units of km), and the line coordinate is the local time on Saturn at the intersection with Saturn’s surface of the line between A and Saturn’s center. Local time is expressed in fractional hours, from 0.0 (at midnight) to 12.0 (at noon), to 24.0 (at midnight). We have not generated point perspective projections for the ring observations because few ring observations were taken in a way that would make point perspective images useful.
